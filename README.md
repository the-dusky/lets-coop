# lets-coop
A turnkey solution for formation and operation of community cooperatives.

# v0 plan
The purpose of this project is to provide tools to people so they can take control of their future through local collaboration and coordination. In short, tools to coop. 

The vision is a toolset that gives a motivated individual all they need to form and operate a neighborhood cooperative. But we are about more than a product. We want to empower individuals to take control of their lives now! So we will get started with articles and tutorials that teach poeple technology based skills that can apply right away.
