A marketplace for turnkey applications that allow businesses to offer non-convention business models.

# Example Apps
## All Or Nothing - A commerce platform that encourages a markup and discount that balance for customers in need and those who can afford more
## OurMoney - A banking app that anonymously (Enigma.co) shares of other users to help people learn the way others are successful
## LetsCo-op Food - An ecomm and point of sale application that makes starting a food Co-op dead simple.

# v0 plan
The purpose of this project is to provide tools to people so they can take control of their future through local collaboration and coordination. In short, tools to co-op. 

The vision is a set of tools (much like zoho suite) that gives business's and individuals ways to worrk cooperatively and still thrive.  Our flagship product, lets-coop.com is tool for building neighborhood coops from micro-level to at scale. Others will follow with the idea that we will build tools that may fail. Not the software, but the strategy they offer. With Failure we will find new strategies that suceed and make the world a better place.

In addition, Let-Coop Join, will be an entry point for people with no development or business experience into fold. Through training, we will build an movement of newly empowered individuals who can make us, but more importantly, themselves better.
